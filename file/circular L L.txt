Advantages of a circular linked list :

Some problems are circular and a circular data structure would be more natural when used to represent it

The entire list can be traversed starting from any node (traverse means visit every node just once)

fewer special cases when coding(all nodes have a node before and after it)

It is concerned with the accessibility of a node.

In Circular list every node is accessible from given node.

From this given node all nodes can be reached by many changing through the list.

It concerns the deletion operation. In singly linked list to delete desired node, it is necessary to give the address of first node of the list.

This necessity result from the fact that in order to delete desired node. The predecessor of this node has to be found.

To find the predecessor required that a search could be carried out by changing through node from the first node of the list such requirement doesn’t exist for circular list.
